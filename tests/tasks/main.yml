# Tests the changes made to the system firewall by this role

# Management and configuration checks
# These checks mirror individual tasks to ensure they execute correctly
# (I.e. that they create a user in the right package or create the correct config file)

# Core configuration

- include: install-firewall.yml

- include: configure-firewall.yml

- include: register-role.yml

# Functionality checks
# These checks need to run after the package or service has been configured to ensure it is working correctly,
# using an configuration that may have been set by this role.

# In this role functionality checks are verified by an external VM (to check if ports are open or closed).
# To do this a special port testing VM will run the 'functional-tests.yml' task file located alongside this file.
