# Specify any Ansible roles used in playbooks used in this project here.
# The order roles are listed in this file does not matter, this is set within playbooks.

# For roles available on Ansible Galaxy you do not need to install dependencies, they will be downloaded for you.
# For other roles, you will need to manually resolve any dependencies by listing them in this file.

# See: http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/galaxy.html for more information.

# As this role is part of the 'system-security' and 'system-core' meta-roles we need to explicitly list the other roles
# dependencies which would normally be provided for us by listing the meta role.

# Unlike projects, role dependencies are not pinned to ensure roles always work with the latest role versions.

# Note: The 'bas-ansible-roles-collection.system-hostname' role is currently unavailable through Ansible Galaxy.
# Until this bug is resolved, this role is referenced directly from GitHub as a workaround.
